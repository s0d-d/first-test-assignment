# First Test Assignment for ELLTY

This is a simple HTML and CSS project demonstrating a custom form with checkboxes by replicating figma components. The form allows users to select individual checkboxes or use a "Select All" feature to toggle all checkboxes at once. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Semantic HTML structure.
- CSS3: Custom styles for form elements.
- JavaScript: Logic for checkbox selection.

## Demo
You can see a live demo of the project [here on Netlify](https://remarkable-pudding-150fe1.netlify.app).
